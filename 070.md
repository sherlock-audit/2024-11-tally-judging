# Deployment Will Fail on ZKSync Due to EVM Incompatibility

## Summary
The `GovernanceStakerDelegateSurrogateVotes` contract uses direct contract creation (`new` keyword) for surrogate deployment, which is incompatible with ZKSync's modified EVM. The protocol has explicitly stated that it must be compatible with any EVM chain, but the current implementation will cause critical functionality failures if deployed on ZKSync.

## Vulnerability Details
In `GovernanceStakerDelegateSurrogateVotes.sol`, the contract deploys surrogate contracts using the `new` keyword:

```solidity
function _fetchOrDeploySurrogate(address _delegatee) internal virtual override returns (DelegationSurrogate _surrogate) {
    _surrogate = storedSurrogates[_delegatee];

    if (address(_surrogate) == address(0)) {
        // @audit This will fail on ZKSync
        _surrogate = new DelegationSurrogateVotes(IERC20Delegates(address(STAKE_TOKEN)), _delegatee);
        storedSurrogates[_delegatee] = _surrogate;
        emit SurrogateDeployed(_delegatee, address(_surrogate));
    }
}
```

The issue arises because of ZKSync's unique contract deployment mechanism:

1. On ZKSync Era, contract deployment is performed using the hash of the bytecode
2. The `factoryDeps` field of EIP712 transactions contains the bytecode
3. The actual deployment occurs by providing the contract's hash to the ContractDeployer system contract
4. For `create/create2` to work correctly, the compiler must know the bytecode in advance
5. The compiler interprets calldata arguments as incomplete input for ContractDeployer

As stated in the [ZKSync documentation](https://docs.zksync.io/build/developer-reference/ethereum-differences/evm-instructions):
> "The compiler interprets the calldata arguments as incomplete input for ContractDeployer, as the remaining part is filled in by the compiler internally. The Yul datasize and dataoffset instructions have been adjusted to return the constant size and bytecode hash rather than the bytecode itself."

## Impact
**HIGH**. If deployed on ZKSync:
- Surrogate contract deployment will completely fail
- Users cannot delegate their voting power
- Core staking functionality becomes unusable
- Protocol's cross-chain compatibility requirement is violated
- The entire protocol becomes non-functional on ZKSync

## Code Snippet
```solidity
// In GovernanceStakerDelegateSurrogateVotes.sol
function _fetchOrDeploySurrogate(address _delegatee) internal virtual override returns (DelegationSurrogate _surrogate) {
    if (address(_surrogate) == address(0)) {
        // This fails on ZKSync due to incompatible deployment mechanism
        _surrogate = new DelegationSurrogateVotes(
            IERC20Delegates(address(STAKE_TOKEN)), 
            _delegatee
        );
    }
}
```
