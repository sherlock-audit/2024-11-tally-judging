# earningPower Breaks Key Invariants

# Summary

The reward accounting system in `GovernanceStaker` operates under the assumption that the weight of users' staked positions can only change through their own interactions with specific functions, such as `stake` and `withdraw`. However, the current implementation links the `earningPower` of delegatees to multiple users. This causes `earningPower` changes to affect all linked users collectively, rather than adjusting individually for each user linked to a delegatee.

# Root Case

* https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-tally/blob/main/staker/src/BinaryEligibilityOracleEarningPowerCalculator.sol#L168

This function modifies the score of delegatees, which directly should impacts the weight of multiple users' positions. As a result, desynchronization occurs in the rates at which users should earn rewards.

# Impact

* Some users could earn higher rewards than intended, while others might earn significantly less or no rewards at all to offset those gains.

# Mitigation

Change the approach to ensure that these adjustments occur automatically through user-initiated interactions.
