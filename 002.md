# When The `totalEarningPower` Is Zero, The Rewards Are Locked

### Summary
When the `totalEarningPower` is zero, `lastCheckpointTime` is updated current time, but there is no one to receive the reward.

### Root Cause
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-tally/blob/main/staker/src/GovernanceStaker.sol#L750

### Internal pre-conditions
N/A

### External pre-conditions
N/A

### Attack Path
N/A

### Impact
Rewards may be locked in this contract indefinitely.

### PoC
```solidity
GovernanceStaker.sol
294:    function lastTimeRewardDistributed() public view virtual returns (uint256) {
            if (rewardEndTime <= block.timestamp) return rewardEndTime;
            else return block.timestamp;
        }
        function _checkpointGlobalReward() internal virtual {
            rewardPerTokenAccumulatedCheckpoint = rewardPerTokenAccumulated();
750:        lastCheckpointTime = lastTimeRewardDistributed();
        }
430:    function notifyRewardAmount(uint256 _amount) external virtual {
            if (!isRewardNotifier[msg.sender]) {
                revert GovernanceStaker__Unauthorized("not notifier", msg.sender);
            }

            // We checkpoint the accumulator without updating the timestamp at which it was updated,
            // because that second operation will be done after updating the reward rate.
            rewardPerTokenAccumulatedCheckpoint = rewardPerTokenAccumulated();

            if (block.timestamp >= rewardEndTime) {
440:            scaledRewardRate = (_amount * SCALE_FACTOR) / REWARD_DURATION;
            } else {
                uint256 _remainingReward = scaledRewardRate * (rewardEndTime - block.timestamp);
443:            scaledRewardRate = (_remainingReward + _amount * SCALE_FACTOR) / REWARD_DURATION;
            }

            rewardEndTime = block.timestamp + REWARD_DURATION;
            lastCheckpointTime = block.timestamp;

            if ((scaledRewardRate / SCALE_FACTOR) == 0) revert GovernanceStaker__InvalidRewardRate();

            // This check cannot _guarantee_ sufficient rewards have been transferred to the contract,
            // because it cannot isolate the unclaimed rewards owed to stakers left in the balance. While
            // this check is useful for preventing degenerate cases, it is not sufficient. Therefore, it is
            // critical that only safe reward notifier contracts are approved to call this method by the
            // admin.
            if (
                (scaledRewardRate * REWARD_DURATION) > (REWARD_TOKEN.balanceOf(address(this)) * SCALE_FACTOR)
            ) revert GovernanceStaker__InsufficientRewardBalance();

            emit RewardNotified(_amount, msg.sender);
        }
```
This protocol provides rewards over time, with a set start and end time, and `scaledRewardRate`(L440,L443).
After `totalEarningPower` goes to zero, the protocol still attempts to provide rewards, and the `lastCheckpointTime` is updated to the current time, but there is no one to receive these rewards.
As a result, these rewards locked in this contract indefinitely.

### Mitigation
When `totalEarningPower` is zero, 
`lastCheckpointTime` should not be updated to the current time, or alternatively, 
`rewardEndTime` should be increased by the same value as the increment of `lastCheckpointTime`.

```diff
        function _checkpointGlobalReward() internal virtual {
            rewardPerTokenAccumulatedCheckpoint = rewardPerTokenAccumulated();
+           uint256 _lastCheckpointTime = lastTimeRewardDistributed();
+           if (totalEarningPower == 0) rewardEndTime += (_lastCheckpointTime - lastCheckpointTime);
+           lastCheckpointTime = _lastCheckpointTime;
-750:       lastCheckpointTime = lastTimeRewardDistributed();
        }
```
