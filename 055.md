# Precision Loss in `notifyRewardAmount` Function Causes Unclaimable RewardToken

## Summary
The `notifyRewardAmount` function suffers from precision loss when calculating the reward rate, leading to some rewards being locked and unclaimable.


## Vulnerability Detail
there is a precision loss in the `notifyRewardAmount` function when calculating `scaledRewardRate`, which results in some of the reward funds being locked in the contract and not being available for distribution. This leads to economic loss.

function notifyRewardAmount(uint256 _amount) external virtual {
    if (!isRewardNotifier[msg.sender]) {
      revert GovernanceStaker__Unauthorized("not notifier", msg.sender);
    }

    // We checkpoint the accumulator without updating the timestamp at which it was updated,
    // because that second operation will be done after updating the reward rate.
    rewardPerTokenAccumulatedCheckpoint = rewardPerTokenAccumulated();

    if (block.timestamp >= rewardEndTime) {
      scaledRewardRate = (_amount * SCALE_FACTOR) / REWARD_DURATION;
    } else {
      uint256 _remainingReward = scaledRewardRate * (rewardEndTime - block.timestamp);
      scaledRewardRate = (_remainingReward + _amount * SCALE_FACTOR) / REWARD_DURATION;
    }

    rewardEndTime = block.timestamp + REWARD_DURATION;
    lastCheckpointTime = block.timestamp;

    if ((scaledRewardRate / SCALE_FACTOR) == 0) revert GovernanceStaker__InvalidRewardRate();

    // This check cannot _guarantee_ sufficient rewards have been transferred to the contract,
    // because it cannot isolate the unclaimed rewards owed to stakers left in the balance. While
    // this check is useful for preventing degenerate cases, it is not sufficient. Therefore, it is
    // critical that only safe reward notifier contracts are approved to call this method by the
    // admin.
    if (
      (scaledRewardRate * REWARD_DURATION) > (REWARD_TOKEN.balanceOf(address(this)) * SCALE_FACTOR)
    ) revert GovernanceStaker__InsufficientRewardBalance();

    emit RewardNotified(_amount, msg.sender);
  }



## Impact
`notifyRewardAmount` function results in a portion of the reward funds being locked in the contract and unavailable for distribution.

## Recommendation
Add an admin function to extract the reward tokens that remain undistributed due to precision loss.
