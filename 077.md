# CREATE opcode works differently in the `zkSync` chain

## Summary
`zkSync mainnet`  chain has differences in the usage of the create opcode compared to the EVM.

According to the mentioned details, the protocol can be deployed in zkSync mainnet.
> Ethereum, Arbitrum, Rari Chain, zkSync Mainnet, Base, Polygon, OP Mainnet.

## Vulnerability Detail
The zkSync Era docs explain how it differs from Ethereum.

Check the description of CREATE ([zkSynce Era Docs](https://docs.zksync.io/zksync-protocol/differences/contract-deployment#ethereum-zksync-differences-in-contract-deployment)) and it is also stated that Create cannot be used for arbitrary code unknown to the compiler.

## Impact
zkSync uses a different compilation and deployment process than Ethereum.
Deployment might fail.
