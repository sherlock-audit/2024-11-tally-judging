# Deposit owners exploit incentives, undermining third-party participation

## **Summary**
The `bumpEarningPower` function is intended to reward third-party callers (bumpers) for triggering updates to a deposit's earning power when its conditions qualify for an update. However, due to unrestricted access, deposit owners or reward claimers can abuse this function to self-trigger updates at intervals of `updateEligibilityDelay`, effectively farming the tip incentive. This undermines the purpose of the incentive system, potentially leading to unfair distribution of rewards and discouragement of third-party participation.

## **Vulnerability Detail**
The key issue lies in the design of the `bumpEarningPower` function, which does not restrict the caller to non-owners or third parties. As a result:

1. **Mechanism Misuse:** The owner or the reward claimer of a deposit can repeatedly call `bumpEarningPower`, claiming the incentive for themselves. This incentivizes self-dealing rather than leveraging third-party assistance.
2. **Functionality Redundancy:** The `bumpEarningPower` function becomes effectively redundant for third parties, as they have no opportunity to earn the tip incentive due to owners monopolizing the calls.

## **Impact**
- **Loss of Third-Party Participation:** The incentive mechanism fails to attract third-party bumpers.
- **Potential Centralization of Rewards:** Owners or claimants can monopolize the function, draining rewards at the expense of other participants.

## **Recommendation**
**Restrict Caller Access:**
   - Add a condition to ensure the caller of `bumpEarningPower` is neither the owner nor the reward claimer of the deposit. For example:
   ```solidity
   if (msg.sender == deposit.owner || msg.sender == deposit.claimer) {
       revert GovernanceStaker__Unauthorized("Owner or claimer cannot bump", msg.sender);
   }
   ```
