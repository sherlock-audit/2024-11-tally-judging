# Anyone can Withdraw staked tokens from an existing deposit on behalf of a user via `withdrawOnBehalf`

## Summary
The `withdrawOnBehalf` function allows anyone to withdraw staked tokens on behalf of a user (`_depositor`) if they possess a valid `_signature`. However, the function lacks proper validation to restrict the caller (`msg.sender`) from initiating withdrawals unless they are authorized by the depositor. This creates a critical vulnerability as malicious actors can exploit valid signatures to withdraw funds from deposits without the user’s consent.

## Vulnerability Detail


## Impact
Anyone with access to a valid _signature can withdraw funds from deposits without the user’s consent.
