# The `bumpEarningPower` function can't change the depositId's earning power

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail


In the GovernanceStaker contract, users can stake their tokens and set a `_delegatee` address that earns rewards based on that. However, after some time, the `_delegatee` may become ineligible for earning power. When a user claims their rewards, the `_delegatee` may become eligible again. The problem is that the `bumpEarningPower` function cannot change this depositId's earning power because `deposit.scaledUnclaimedRewardCheckpoint` will always be zero. This means that the delegatee has the voting power, but the staker cannot earn rewards. This breaks the invariant of bumpEarningPower that states that when a qualifying change in the earning power is returned by the earning power calculator, the deposit's earning power should be updated.


```solidity
  /// @notice A function that a bumper can call to update a deposit's earning power when a
  /// qualifying change in the earning power is returned by the earning power calculator. A
  /// deposit's earning power may change as determined by the algorithm of the current earning power
  /// calculator. In order to incentivize bumpers to trigger these updates a portion of deposit's
  /// unclaimed rewards are sent to the bumper.
  /// @param _depositId The identifier for the deposit that needs an updated earning power.
  /// @param _tipReceiver The receiver of the reward for updating a deposit's earning power.
  /// @param _requestedTip The amount of tip requested by the third-party.
  function bumpEarningPower(
    DepositIdentifier _depositId,
    address _tipReceiver,
    uint256 _requestedTip
  ) external virtual {
    if (_requestedTip > maxBumpTip) revert GovernanceStaker__InvalidTip();

    Deposit storage deposit = deposits[_depositId];

    _checkpointGlobalReward();
    _checkpointReward(deposit);

@>>    uint256 _unclaimedRewards = deposit.scaledUnclaimedRewardCheckpoint / SCALE_FACTOR;

    (uint256 _newEarningPower, bool _isQualifiedForBump) = earningPowerCalculator.getNewEarningPower(
      deposit.balance, deposit.owner, deposit.delegatee, deposit.earningPower
    );
    if (!_isQualifiedForBump || _newEarningPower == deposit.earningPower) {
      revert GovernanceStaker__Unqualified(_newEarningPower);
    }

@>>    if (_newEarningPower > deposit.earningPower && _unclaimedRewards < _requestedTip) {
      revert GovernanceStaker__InsufficientUnclaimedRewards();
    }

    // Note: underflow causes a revert if the requested  tip is more than unclaimed rewards
    if (_newEarningPower < deposit.earningPower && (_unclaimedRewards - _requestedTip) < maxBumpTip)
    {
      revert GovernanceStaker__InsufficientUnclaimedRewards();
    }

    // Update global earning power & deposit earning power based on this bump
    totalEarningPower =
      _calculateTotalEarningPower(deposit.earningPower, _newEarningPower, totalEarningPower);
    depositorTotalEarningPower[deposit.owner] = _calculateTotalEarningPower(
      deposit.earningPower, _newEarningPower, depositorTotalEarningPower[deposit.owner]
    );
    deposit.earningPower = _newEarningPower.toUint96();

    // Send tip to the receiver
    SafeERC20.safeTransfer(REWARD_TOKEN, _tipReceiver, _requestedTip);
    deposit.scaledUnclaimedRewardCheckpoint =
      deposit.scaledUnclaimedRewardCheckpoint - (_requestedTip * SCALE_FACTOR);
  }
```

## Impact

The delegatee has the voting power, but the staker cannot earn rewards.
