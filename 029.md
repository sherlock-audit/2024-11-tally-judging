# Deposit owners can exploit `stakeMore` and `withdraw` to prevent incentives for Bumpers

### **Summary**
The design of the `bumpEarningPower` function, which allows third-party bumpers to update the earning power of a `Deposit` and receive incentives, can be invalidated by the `Deposit` owner. The owner can exploit the `stakeMore` or `withdraw` functions with minimal amounts, disrupting the earning power update process and denying bumpers their intended incentives. This undermines the protocol's mechanism to encourage bumpers to call `bumpEarningPower`.

### **Root Cause**
The following issues allow `Deposit` owners to bypass the protocol's intent:
1. **No Minimum Amount for `stakeMore` or `withdraw`**:
   - The `stakeMore` and `withdraw` functions do not enforce a minimum limit on the amount of tokens that can be staked or withdrawn.
   - As a result, the `Deposit` owner can call these functions with negligible amounts solely to trigger an earning power update.

2. **Frequent Calls During `updateEligibilityDelay`**:
   - The `updateEligibilityDelay` in `getNewEarningPower` enforces a delay before earning power can be updated again.
   - The owner can reset this delay repeatedly by calling `stakeMore` or `withdraw` with minimal amounts, effectively blocking bumpers from calling `bumpEarningPower` during this period.

### **Impact**
1. **Protocol Design Undermined**:
   - The incentive mechanism for bumpers is rendered ineffective as owners block updates by exploiting small-value staking or withdrawals.
   
2. **Loss of Bumper Participation**:
   - Without incentives, bumpers are unlikely to participate, weakening the protocol's ability to update earning power efficiently.

3. **Unfair Advantage for `Deposit` Owners**:
   - Owners gain disproportionate control over the process, negating the intent of third-party interventions.

### **Mitigation**
1. **Set Minimum Transaction Limits**:
   - Introduce a minimum threshold for the amount of tokens that can be staked or withdrawn in `stakeMore` and `withdraw`.

2. **Restrict Frequency of Updates**:
   - Enforce a cooldown period for the `stakeMore` and `withdraw` functions to prevent repeated calls within a short timeframe.
