# Lack of incentives to call bumpEarningPower for small rewards

## Summary
Since the tip that will be received in the `bumpEarningPower` function must be less or equal to the minimum between the unclaimed fees and the maxBumpTip, if the rewards are too small, there is a lack of incentives to call this function.

## Vulnerability Detail
Here we can see that the tip that will be received in the `bumpEarningPower` must be less or equal to the minimum between the unclaimed fees and the maxBumpTip in the bumpEarningPower function.

```solidity
    uint256 _unclaimedRewards = deposit.scaledUnclaimedRewardCheckpoint / SCALE_FACTOR;

    (uint256 _newEarningPower, bool _isQualifiedForBump) = earningPowerCalculator.getNewEarningPower(
      deposit.balance, deposit.owner, deposit.delegatee, deposit.earningPower
    );
    if (!_isQualifiedForBump || _newEarningPower == deposit.earningPower) {
      revert GovernanceStaker__Unqualified(_newEarningPower);
    }

    if (_newEarningPower > deposit.earningPower && _unclaimedRewards < _requestedTip) {
      revert GovernanceStaker__InsufficientUnclaimedRewards();
    }

    // Note: underflow causes a revert if the requested  tip is more than unclaimed rewards
    if (_newEarningPower < deposit.earningPower && (_unclaimedRewards - _requestedTip) < maxBumpTip)
    {
      revert GovernanceStaker__InsufficientUnclaimedRewards();
    }

```
Otherwise, the call will revert because of an underflow or a custom error. But if the reward is very small, then there is a clear lack of incentives to call this function.


## Impact
Some deposits’ earning power will not be updated by bumpers, which can lead to problems in the protocol’s accounting.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
In order to mitigate this issue, the protocol should implement a function that batches the protocol IDs in order to bump the earning power of many deposits at the same time and share the tip paid proportionally.
