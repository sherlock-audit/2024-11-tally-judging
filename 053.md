# Malicious users can steal rewards for a certain period of time

## Summary

Malicious users can steal rewards for a certain period of time.

## Vulnerability Detail

Assume that Bob (a large staker) has a special agreement with his delegetee that he will never change the delegetee under any circumstance. 

At some point later, his deletegee does some bad thing, and his deletegee's score will be reduced by the oracle. However, due to the agreement, Bob still has to continue forwarding his voting power to the same delegetee, but he does not want to lose any rewards. Thus, he can perform the trick to obtain as many rewards as possible for a period of time until his earning power gets reset to zero eventually.

Assume that Bob has unclaimed rewards of 500 ARB and an earning power of 100. He observed that his delegatee score would be updated to below the eligibility threshold in the incoming `updateDelegateeScore` transaction, which will cause his earning power to drop to zero if someone bumped his earning power via the `bumpEarningPowier` function.

Bob front-runs the TX and claims all the unclaimed rewards. Thus, the Bob's `_unclaimedRewards` becomes zero.

Subsequently, the `updateDelegateeScore` transaction gets executed, and Bob's delegetee becomes ineligible.

Alice (another staker in the system) wants to reset Bob's earning power to zero so that Bob is not "stealing" her portion of the total rewards. This is because Bob still has a large stake in the system, which diverts significant rewards streamed from others. Bob should not be entitled to these rewards because his earning power technically should be zero now due to ineligible delegatee. Thus, Bob's earning power is actually inflated and outdated.

Alice executes `bumpEarningPower` function against Bob's account, but the transaction will revert because Bob's `_unclaimedRewards` ( = zero) is below `maxBumpTip`, and the condition at Line 497 below will evaluated as `False`.

Let the time duration for Bob's unclaimed rewards increase from zero to 0.01 ARB be $D$ seconds. Thus, Bob continues to earn rewards that he is not supposed to for a period of time ($D$) until the `maxBumpTip` (0.01 ARB) is reached. Note that any caller to the `bumpEarningPower` function has to wait for $D$ seconds due to the condition (`(_unclaimedRewards - _requestedTip) < maxBumpTip`) in Line 497 below, which will always revert until `maxBumpTip` is reached.

This constitutes an issue since it is effectively stealing from other stakers for a duration of $D$ seconds. The loss will be significant and aggravated if:

- Bob's earning power is significant. In this scenario, this is true because Bob is a large staker.
- The current reward rate is high, which allows Bob to steal more rewards within $D$ seconds.
- The block interval on the chain is long (e.g., 12 seconds on Ethereum). As a result, each unsuccessful bump allows Bob to delay for a longer time and claim more rewards before his earning power gets reset by other users.

## Impact

Loss of assets for other stakers in the system, as mentioned in the report.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider letting the users decide if they will want to proceed to execute `bumpEarningPower` function even if there is no tip in return because users will be incentivized to do so even without any tip under certain scenarios.

The callers of the `bumpEarningPower` function do not always call this function for the sake of getting a small portion of the reward tokens as fees/tips. This is especially true if the target staker to be bumped holds a significant stake in the system, and resetting their earning power will allow the callers to earn more rewards. In this scenario, the profit from earning more rewards if the target staker's earning power is reset to zero will be much more than the gas price they paid for executing the `bumpEarningPower` function.

This is even more true in L2 environment where the gas fee for executing `bumpEarningPower` function costs almost nothing, but the rewards that can be earned will be worth much more.
