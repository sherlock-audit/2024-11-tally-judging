## Vulnerability Detail
If a user calls ```bumpEarningPower()``` to update the earning power of a staker, since there is no limit to when this call can be made, it is possible that this call being made when the max reward has been made available and caller request all of it. If all is sent to the caller, there will be nothing left for protocol to deduct reward fee from. 

## Impact
Protocol loses fee on rewards

## Code Snippet
```solidity
 uint256 _unclaimedRewards = deposit.scaledUnclaimedRewardCheckpoint / SCALE_FACTOR;
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Deduct protocol fee from ```_unclaimedRewards``` in ```bumpEarningPower()```  and send fee to the recipient.
