# `lastCheckpointTime` is updated even when the `totalEarningPower` is zero and causes reward tokens to be stuck in the contract

## Summary

Stakers accumulate rewards monotonically over time. But when the `totalEarningPower` equals `0`, the `lastCheckpointTime` is updated even though the `rewardPerTokenAccumulatedCheckpoint` stays the same. Consequently, the total amount of reward tokens that has been sent to the contract cannot be accumulated and will remain in the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail

When `rewardPerTokenAccumulated()` is called but the `totalEarningPower` equals `0`, it is not updated. However, the `lastCheckpointTime` is updated.

```solidity
  function _checkpointGlobalReward() internal virtual {
    rewardPerTokenAccumulatedCheckpoint = rewardPerTokenAccumulated();
    lastCheckpointTime = lastTimeRewardDistributed();
  }
```

As a result, reward tokens will remain in the contract and cannot be accumulated in the future.

## Impact

Reward tokens which have not been accumulated will remain in the contract. If noone staked during the whole reward duration, the whole reward amount remains in the contract.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider implementing a withdraw functionality so that leftover reward tokens can be withdrawn.
