# [H-1] Claimer can only claim rewards for deposits that they are BOTH the claimer and owner

## Summary

in `GovernanceStaker::claimReward` claimers who are not BOTH the claimer and owner of a deposit can never claim their rewards. The only claimers that can claim rewards are those who are BOTH the designated claimer and owner of a deposit - when it is clear that `claimers` are entitled to claim rewards even if they are not the owner of the deposit.

## Vulnerability Detail

Several places within the documentation state `claimer account has the right to withdraw rewards` - there is specific functionality that allows and facilitates the `claimer` address to be different from the `owner` address of a deposit. 

The `claimReward` function has documentation that states `msg.sender` must be the claimer address of the deposit` - but even if they are, they cannot withdraw / claim the rewards that they are entitled to unless they are ALSO the owner of the deposit - which is not the intended functionality. This is because of the following check:

`     if (deposit.claimer != msg.sender && deposit.owner != msg.sender) {
      revert GovernanceStaker__Unauthorized("not claimer or owner", msg.sender);
    }`

## Impact

Claimers who are not also the owner of the deposit will not be able to claim rewards. Not only that, any deposits that have a different `claimer` and `owner` will never be able to have their rewards claimed. Those rewards will never be able to be claimed. 

## Code Snippet

`function claimReward(DepositIdentifier _depositId) external virtual returns (uint256) {
    Deposit storage deposit = deposits[_depositId];
    if (deposit.claimer != msg.sender && deposit.owner != msg.sender) {
        revert GovernanceStaker__Unauthorized("not claimer or owner", msg.sender);
     }
    return _claimReward(_depositId, deposit, msg.sender);
  }`


## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

There are 2 different solutions that the protocol can take:

1. If the `owner` of the deposit can claim rewards for the claimer (the claimer will still be the receiving address) :
- Change the check to `||` instead of `&&`. Which will allow rewards to be claimed if the `msg.sender` is either the `claimer` or `owner`.

2. If only the claimer is allowed to claim rewards:
- Change the check to only check if `msg.sender` is the `claimer`
