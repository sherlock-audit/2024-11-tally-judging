# Incorrect Check for Tip Amount in `bumpEarningPower` Function

## Description:
The `bumpEarningPower` function allows a third party (bumper) to update a deposit's earning power and receive a tip from the deposit's unclaimed rewards. However, the logic for ensuring the requested tip does not exceed the unclaimed rewards is flawed. Specifically, the following condition:
```solidity
if (_newEarningPower < deposit.earningPower && (_unclaimedRewards - _requestedTip) < maxBumpTip) {
    revert GovernanceStaker__InsufficientUnclaimedRewards();
}
```
is incorrectly designed and does not effectively ensure that `_requestedTip` is less than or equal to `_unclaimedRewards`.

## code snippet:

## Vulnerability Details:
#### Logical Error:
The condition `(_unclaimedRewards - _requestedTip) < maxBumpTip` does not directly validate whether `_requestedTip` exceeds `_unclaimedRewards`. It instead checks the result of subtracting `_requestedTip` from `_unclaimedRewards` against `maxBumpTip`. which would cause it to revert if the `_unclaimedRewards` is barely >`_requestedTip`

## Impact:
The incorrect check would cause valid `_unclaimedRewards` and `_requestedTip` to fail.

## Mitigation:
Replace the flawed condition with an explicit check that ensures `_requestedTip` does not exceed `_unclaimedRewards`. This prevents underflow and ensures correct validation of the tip amount.
```solidity
if (_newEarningPower < deposit.earningPower && _requestedTip > _unclaimedRewards) {
    revert GovernanceStaker__InsufficientUnclaimedRewards();
}
```
