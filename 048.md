# Users Can Exploit STALE_ORACLE_WINDOW to Obtain Maximum Possible EarningPower

# Summary

The `GovernanceStaker::_stake` function fetches the `_earningPower` from the `earningPowerCalculator`. However, when the `STALE_ORACLE_WINDOW` is exceeded, the function assumes and returns the maximum possible `_earningPower`. In scenarios with low activity or a very short `STALE_ORACLE_WINDOW`, this behavior can be exploited.

# Root Case

* https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-tally/blob/main/staker/src/GovernanceStaker.sol#L571

* https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-tally/blob/main/staker/src/BinaryEligibilityOracleEarningPowerCalculator.sol#L152

The logic shows that when the `STALE_ORACLE_WINDOW` is exceeded, the maximum possible `_earningPower` is assumed and returned.

# Internal pre-conditions

* A very short STALE_ORACLE_WINDOW.

* Low protocol activity.

# External pre-conditions

# Attack Path

***No response***

# Impact

Users could exploit these conditions to obtain the maximum `EarningPower` from delegates who do not meet the `delegateeEligibilityThresholdScore` minimum requirements.

# Mitigation

The `_isDelegateeEligible` check should be enforced to prevent abuse.
