# Incompatibility of contracts with Ethereum ARB token.

## Summary


In the README mention that the contracts are deployed in the below chains

> Ethereum, Arbitrum, Rari Chain, zkSync Mainnet, Base, Polygon, OP Mainnet


Additionally, ARB is used as both a staked and reward token; however, the issue here is that ARB tokens exist on the Ethereum blockchain and some others, according to the [documentation](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/deployment-addresses).


## Vulnerability Detail

So when we check the ARB token contract implementation in the [Ethereum](https://etherscan.io/address/0xad0c361ef902a7d9851ca7dcc85535da2d3c6fc7#code), it becomes evident that it is no compatibile with IERC20Delegates. Therefore, these contracts are not deployed on the Ethereum blockchain with the ARB Governance token.

```solidity
contract L1ArbitrumToken is
    INovaArbOneReverseToken,
    Initializable,
    ERC20Upgradeable,
    ERC20PermitUpgradeable,
    TransferAndCallToken
{
```

In the GovernanceStakerDelegateSurrogateVotes contract, the constructor includes the following check:


```solidity
  constructor(IERC20Delegates _votingToken) {
    if (address(STAKE_TOKEN) != address(_votingToken)) {
      revert GovernanceStakerDelegateSurrogateVotes__UnauthorizedToken();
    }
  }
```

In the Ethereum chain, the ARB token contract implementation does not have a `delegate` function, so this will revert.

```solidity
contract DelegationSurrogateVotes is DelegationSurrogate {
  /// @param _token The governance token that will be held by this surrogate
  /// @param _delegatee The address of the would-be voter to which this surrogate will delegate its
  /// voting weight. 100% of all voting tokens held by this surrogate will be delegated to this
  /// address.
  constructor(IERC20Delegates _token, address _delegatee) DelegationSurrogate(_token) {
@>>    _token.delegate(_delegatee);
  }
```

## Impact
The `ARB` token exists on Ethereum, but the contracts are incompatible with the implementation and won't be deployed. As a result, this breaks the invariants stated in the README.
