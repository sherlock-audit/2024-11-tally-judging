# Signature replay possible in GovernanceStakerOnBehalf, as chainID is not added to the signature

## Summary
As the protocol is going to be deployed on multiple chains "Ethereum, Arbitrum, Rari Chain, zkSync Mainnet, Base, Polygon, OP Mainnet", this could mean that signatures could be reused to stake/stake more on behalf of a user. 

## Vulnerability Detail
There is no `chain.id` in the signed data

## Impact
If a malicious user does a `stakeOnBehalf`, ` stakeMoreOnBehalf`, chainId is missing which means that the same stake can be replayed on a different chain for the same account.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Include the `chain.id` in what's hashed
