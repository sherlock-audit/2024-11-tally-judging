# A malicious user can pay less fees when he claim rewards

## Summary
Because the feeAmount to pay when a user claims fees is a constant, a user may wait to claim their rewards in order to pay fees only once and limit the total fees paid.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the _claimReward function, the fees paid is a variable set by the admin and deducted from the reward claimable, as we can see here:
```solidity
 function _claimReward(DepositIdentifier _depositId, Deposit storage deposit, address _claimer)
    internal
    virtual
    returns (uint256)
  {
    _checkpointGlobalReward();
    _checkpointReward(deposit);

    uint256 _reward = deposit.scaledUnclaimedRewardCheckpoint / SCALE_FACTOR;
    // Intentionally reverts due to overflow if unclaimed rewards are less than fee.
    uint256 _payout = _reward - claimFeeParameters.feeAmount;
    if (_payout == 0) return 0;
```
The problem is that the fee isnâ€™t a portion of the rewards, meaning that whatever the rewards, the same fee will be paid, which is unfair for all stakers. Moreover, a user could be incentivized to avoid claiming their rewards multiple times in order to limit the fees paid.

## Impact
Users could pay fewer fees by claiming their rewards only once, thereby limiting the fees paid, which would result in a loss for the protocol. Moreover the fees are unfair since everyone pay exactly the same fees.

## Recommendation
The protocol should implement fees that adapt to the rewards received.
