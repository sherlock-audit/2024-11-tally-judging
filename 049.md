# Users Are Susceptible to Slippage in _earningPower When Calling GovernanceStaker::stake

# Summary

The `GovernanceStaker` contract is designed for use via EOAs (Externally Owned Accounts). However, it does not account for scenarios where, due to the delay between the transaction submission and execution, users might experience unexpected distortions. This could result in receiving less—or even no—`_earningPower` from their staking.

# Root Case

None of the external calls in these lines account for such variations, leaving users vulnerable to slippage or even the complete loss of rewards during their staking.
