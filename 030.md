# Claimers can suppress bumpers by exploiting `claimReward` to renew earning power

### **Summary**
The `claimer` of a `Deposit` can suppress bumpers by exploiting the `claimReward` function. Since bumpers receive a portion of the `Deposit`'s unclaimed rewards as incentives, claimers can prevent bumpers from earning incentives by calling `claimReward` to renew their earning power. This action denies bumpers their expected rewards, undermining the protocol's incentive mechanism and shifting the loss to the claimer, as the funds used for bumper incentives are deducted from their own rewards.

### **Root Cause**
The ability of the `claimReward` function to reset the earning power of a `Deposit` without restrictions allows claimers to interfere with the bumper incentive mechanism:
1. **Earning Power Reset in `claimReward`**:
   - Each call to `claimReward` resets the earning power of a `Deposit` using the `earningPowerCalculator.getEarningPower` logic.

2. **No Restriction on Reward Claims**:
   - The function does not enforce a minimum claimable amount and only `returns` if the rewards are zero.
   - This allows claimers to repeatedly call the function with negligible or no rewards purely to refresh their earning power.

3. **Impact on Bumper Incentives**:
   - Bumpers receive incentives from a portion of the `Deposit`'s unclaimed rewards. By claiming rewards frequently, the claimer can reduce or eliminate the unclaimed rewards before the bumper can act.

### **Impact**
1. **Protocol Design Undermined**:
   - The incentive mechanism for bumpers is compromised, discouraging participation and weakening the protocol's ability to update earning power effectively.

2. **Financial Loss to Claimer**:
   - While suppressing bumpers, the claimer sacrifices the protocol's intended earning power updates, potentially leading to reduced overall rewards.

3. **Disincentivized Bumper Participation**:
   - Bumpers, unable to reliably earn incentives, are discouraged from participating, further degrading the protocol's functionality.

### **Mitigation**
1. **Restrict Frequent Calls to `claimReward`**:
   - Introduce a cooldown period for the `claimReward` function to limit how often it can be called, ensuring bumpers have a fair opportunity to act.

2. **Set a Minimum Claim Threshold**:
   - Prevent earning power from being renewed by `revert` function `claimReward` if the claimable amount does not exceed the specified minimum.
