# Redundant Calculation of Total Earning Power in Delegatee Change Process

## Summary
When trying to change delegatees  we do a uselles calculation

```solidity
 totalEarningPower =
      _calculateTotalEarningPower(deposit.earningPower, _newEarningPower, totalEarningPower);
    depositorTotalEarningPower[deposit.owner] = _calculateTotalEarningPower(
      deposit.earningPower, _newEarningPower, depositorTotalEarningPower[deposit.owner]
    );
```
    
## Vulnerability Detail
In the _alterDelegatee function, the calculation of totalEarningPower and depositorTotalEarningPower[deposit.owner] is performed unnecessarily when the delegatee is changed. This is redundant because the deposit.earningPower is already updated with the new delegatee's earning power, and recalculating the total earning power at this level is inefficient and unnecessary.

## Impact
Efficiency Loss: The redundant calculation of totalEarningPower and depositorTotalEarningPower introduces unnecessary computational overhead, increasing gas costs and reducing the efficiency of the function.
Potential for Errors: By performing redundant operations, there's a higher risk of introducing inconsistencies or errors in the future if the logic is modified, especially if these totals are updated elsewhere in the system.
