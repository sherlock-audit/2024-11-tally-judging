# A small amount of protocol fee can not be paid

## Summary
Inappropriate protocol fee can cause stakers unable to pay fee and claim rewards

## Vulnerability Detail
In the function `GovernanceStaker::_claimReward()`, the payout for staker is the claimable amount minus fee.
```solidity
  function _claimReward(DepositIdentifier _depositId, Deposit storage deposit, address _claimer)
    internal
    virtual
    returns (uint256)
  {
    _checkpointGlobalReward();
    _checkpointReward(deposit);

@>    uint256 _reward = deposit.scaledUnclaimedRewardCheckpoint / SCALE_FACTOR;
    // Intentionally reverts due to overflow if unclaimed rewards are less than fee.
@>    uint256 _payout = _reward - claimFeeParameters.feeAmount;
@>    if (_payout == 0) return 0;
    ...
```
In case the staker's unclaimed rewards is small enough, such that `_reward <=  claimFeeParameters.feeAmount`, the staker can not pay fee and claim any rewards token even though there is unclaimed rewards existed. This can be a problem when the [`claimFeeParameters.feeAmount` is set to be a relative high amount](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-tally/blob/b125d1f2b52170a3789b1060a52fc6609e6e2262/staker/src/GovernanceStaker.sol#L799-L813). 

## Impact
- There can be a small amount of fee/rewards can not be paid
