# Malicious Users Can Block Earning Power to keep the high reword

## Summary
Users can **Stop** their earning power from being reduced by manipulating **unclaimed rewards** to block the **bump mechanism**. By **front-running bump transactions** in Ethereum  and maintaining a specific **unclaimed reward balance**, users can keep reword accumulating with high earning powr .

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability arises because **bumper** tips are taken from the user's `accumulatedrewards`. When a user becomes ineligible and their earning power drops to 0,when the `oracles` change the earning power or admin set new `calculator`  . can prevent this by manipulating their unclaimed reward balance.In `GovernanceStaker.sol`.a user could use the underflow to revert the function 
```solidity
 function bumpEarningPower(
    DepositIdentifier _depositId,
    address _tipReceiver,
    uint256 _requestedTip
  ) external virtual {

   // underflow causes a revert if the requested  tip is more than unclaimed rewards
    if (_newEarningPower < deposit.earningPower && @>>>(_unclaimedRewards - _requestedTip) < maxBumpTip)
    {
      revert GovernanceStaker__InsufficientUnclaimedRewards();
    }
//code .....
 }
```
Using this attack :
User earning power: 1000 (should reduce to 0)
Accumulated rewards: 100
Required bumper tip: 15
1. User monitors mempool for bump attempts
2. When a bump is detected, front-run with the claim.
3. Claim most rewards, and leave less than the required tip.

```solidity 
function _claimReward(DepositIdentifier _depositId, Deposit storage deposit, address _claimer) {
    uint256 _reward = deposit.scaledUnclaimedRewardCheckpoint / SCALE_FACTOR;

    uint256 _payout = _reward - 10;  // Leave only 10 tokens
    
    deposit.scaledUnclaimedRewardCheckpoint = 
        deposit.scaledUnclaimedRewardCheckpoint - (_reward * SCALE_FACTOR);
}
```
-Bump transaction fails,
```solidity
// underflow causes a revert if the requested  tip is more than unclaimed rewards
    if (_newEarningPower < deposit.earningPower && @>>>(_unclaimedRewards - _requestedTip) < maxBumpTip)
    {
      revert GovernanceStaker__InsufficientUnclaimedRewards();
    } 
```
User keeps original high earning power, Continues earning at 1000 power instead of 0, the user could reapaet this prosses until the end of the reword duration .

## Impact
Users maintain a high earning power indefinitely, Continue earning rewards at elevated rates even when ineligible,drain protocol rewards unfairly from legitimate users.

## Recommendation

For earning power decreases (when _newEarningPower < deposit.earningPower), remove the tip.
