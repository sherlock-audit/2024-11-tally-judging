# Anyone can Claim reward On Behalf of depositor or claimer via `claimRewardOnBehalf`

## Summary
The `claimRewardOnBehalf` function in the contract allows anyone to claim rewards on behalf of a deposit owner or claimer if they possess a valid `_signature`. However, there are no restrictions requiring the caller of the function to match the `deposit.owner` or `deposit.claimer`. This creates a significant vulnerability, as anyone with access to a valid _signature can claim rewards without being  `deposit.owner` or `deposit.claimer`.

## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact
