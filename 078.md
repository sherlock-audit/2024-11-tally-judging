# Uninitialized immutable variable `MAX_CLAIM_FEE` prevents having a fee collector that receives fees

## Summary
Uninitialized immutable variable `MAX_CLAIM_FEE` prevents admin from setting `feeAmount` to a certain amount `> 0`. `feeCollector` will never receive fees in this contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
Uninitialized immutable variable `MAX_CLAIM_FEE` will always be 0 in this contract. Thus, `feeAmount` will always be `0`. If admin tries to set `feeAmount` to an amount `> 0` the `setClaimFeeParameters(...)` function will revert. It can only be `0` making `feeCollector` useless.

## Impact
`feeCollector` will never receive fees in this contract.
