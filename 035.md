# Missing _checkpointReward(deposit) in GovernanceStaker._stake() can lead to the reward State being Misaligned or Inconsistent

## Summary
The bug arises from a misalignment of the reward state during the staking process, specifically in the _stake function. The issue occurs because the _stake function does not call `_checkpointReward(deposit)` to properly initialize the reward state for new deposits. As a result, when tokens are staked via _stake, the deposit's `scaledUnclaimedRewardCheckpoint` and `rewardPerTokenCheckpoint` are not set to the correct values, causing inconsistencies in reward calculations.

## Vulnerability Detail
The [Stake](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-tally/blob/main/staker/src/GovernanceStaker.sol#L558-L590) function allows users perform staking Operations. But unlike the [_stakeMore](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-tally/blob/main/staker/src/GovernanceStaker.sol#L595-L619) function which adds more stake to an existing deposit., `_checkpointReward(deposit);` is not called. As a result, the reward state is incorrectly initialized for new deposits, creating a risk that rewards could be under-calculated.
In the `_stake` function, new deposits are created but the reward state is not updated (via `_checkpointReward(deposit)`). This means that the `scaledUnclaimedRewardCheckpoint` (which tracks the total unclaimed rewards for a deposit) and `rewardPerTokenCheckpoint` (which tracks the reward rate at the time of staking) are not synchronized with the global reward state.

## Impact
Under calculation of rewards for users in their first deposit.

## Recommendation
Add the _checkpointReward(deposit); to the `stake function`
