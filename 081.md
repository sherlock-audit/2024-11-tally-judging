# Incorrect validation check for tipping amount

## Summary

The `bumpEarningPower` function contains an incorrect validation check for tip amounts against unclaimed rewards, potentially causing valid transactions to fail due to a flawed comparison with `maxBumpTip`.

## Vulnerability Detail
The current validation logic is flawed in its implementation:

- The function uses (`_unclaimedRewards` - `_requestedTip`) < `maxBumpTip` to validate tips
- This check compares the remaining rewards against `maxBumpTip` instead of directly validating if `_requestedTip` exceeds `_unclaimedRewards`
- The condition could cause transactions to fail even when there are sufficient unclaimed rewards to cover the requested tip
- The issue occurs specifically when `_newEarningPower` < `deposit.earningPower`
- 
## Impact
- Valid transactions may be incorrectly reverted
- Bumpers might be unable to claim legitimate tips even when sufficient unclaimed rewards exist
- Function behavior does not align with its intended purpose of ensuring tips don't exceed available rewards
- Could discourage legitimate bumpers from participating in the system

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Replace the current condition with a direct comparison between `_requestedTip` and `_unclaimedRewards`:

```solidity 

if (_newEarningPower < deposit.earningPower && _requestedTip > _unclaimedRewards) {
    revert GovernanceStaker__InsufficientUnclaimedRewards();
}

```

This will properly validate that requested tips don`t exceed available rewards, to prevent incorrect transactions reversions.
