# Attackers Can Call GovernanceStaker::bumpEarningPower and Extract All _unclaimedRewards

# Summary

The `bumpEarningPower` function allows a bumper to update a deposit's earning power when a qualifying change in earning power is determined by the earning power calculator. To incentivize bumpers to trigger these updates, a portion of the deposit's `_unclaimedRewards` is sent to the bumper. However, this portion is not properly limited, allowing abuse.

# Root Case

Relevant code snippets:

* https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-tally/blob/main/staker/src/GovernanceStaker.sol#L492

* https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-tally/blob/main/staker/src/GovernanceStaker.sol#L497

These restrictions are not correctly implemented, enabling cases such as:

* _newEarningPower > deposit.earningPower && _unclaimedRewards === _requestedTip

* _newEarningPower < deposit.earningPower && _requestedTip > maxBumpTip

This allows attackers to extract more tip than intended by the protocol.

# Internal pre-conditions

A deposit qualifies as `_isQualifiedForBump`.

# External pre-conditions

***No response***

# Attack Path

***No response***

# Impact

Users could lose a significant portion—or even all—of their unclaimed rewards.

# Mitigation

Ensure that the `tip` must always be less than or equal to `maxBumpTip`.
