# the `if (_isOracleStale() || isOraclePaused)` check doesnt revert when oracle is stale or paused

## Summary
the `if (_isOracleStale() || isOraclePaused)` check return is wrong 
## Vulnerability Detail
in `getEarningPower` and `getNewEarningPower` we can see there is the `if (_isOracleStale() || isOraclePaused)` check doesnt revert when oracle is stale or paused and returns `_amountStaked` if oracle is stale or paused but the problem is it should't return the `_amountStaked` because this already going to be returned if `_isDelegateeEligible(_delegatee)` and not when oracle is stale or paused 
## Impact
the function doesnt revert when the oracle is stale or paused, hence oracle being stale or paused makes no changes 
## Code Snippet
```solidity 
 function getEarningPower(uint256 _amountStaked, address, /* _staker */ address _delegatee) 
    external
    view
    returns (uint256)
  {
    if (_isOracleStale() || isOraclePaused) return _amountStaked; //@audit why both returns amountstaked even when oracle stale and is eligble?
    return _isDelegateeEligible(_delegatee) ? _amountStaked : 0; //@note calculates nothing here
  }

```

as you saw it doesnt makes any sense at all that this check doesnt prevent anything at all

## Recommendation

- consider modiying the contracts to the way that it reverts when oracle is stale or paused as intended
