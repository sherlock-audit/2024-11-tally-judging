# Uninitialized `MAX_CLAIM_FEE` in `GovernanceStaker` leads to Denial-of-Service in `_setClaimFeeParameters`

## Summary
The `GovernanceStaker` contract includes an immutable variable `MAX_CLAIM_FEE`, but it is not initialized in the base contract. While the [`README`](https://audits.sherlock.xyz/contests/609?filter=questions) does not explicitly confirm or deny whether `GovernanceStaker` is a production contract, the scope requires that we consider it as such.

## Vulnerability Detail
The [`_setClaimFeeParameters`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-tally/blob/b125d1f2b52170a3789b1060a52fc6609e6e2262/staker/src/GovernanceStaker.sol#L799-L813) function in `GovernanceStaker` relies on `MAX_CLAIM_FEE` to validate fee parameters. However, because `MAX_CLAIM_FEE` is not initialized in `GovernanceStaker`, the comparison `_params.feeAmount > MAX_CLAIM_FEE` will always be true, and the function will always revert.

## Impact
- **Denial of Service (DoS**): The admin cannot configure claim fees.
- **Revenue Loss**: Without claim fees, the protocol may be unable to cover operational costs.

## Code Snippet
- **Vulnerable logic** : [_setClaimFeeParameters](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-tally/blob/b125d1f2b52170a3789b1060a52fc6609e6e2262/staker/src/GovernanceStaker.sol#L799C30-L803)
- **Uninitialized variable** : [MAX_CLAIM_FEE](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-tally/blob/b125d1f2b52170a3789b1060a52fc6609e6e2262/staker/src/GovernanceStaker.sol#L171)

## Recommendation
Add this line in the constructor:
```diff
+ MAX_CLAIM_FEE = 1e18;
