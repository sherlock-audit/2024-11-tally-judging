# Oracle Pause Guardian Indefinitely Grants All Stakers Full Rewards

## Summary and Impact
https://github.com/withtally/staker/blob/90802966475239c3eb8aafc3dbf18edd5a0b6b1b/src/BinaryEligibilityOracleEarningPowerCalculator.sol#L130-L137
This vulnerability allows the `oraclePauseGuardian` role to forcefully pause the oracle logic, thereby triggering fallback behavior that grants *every* staker 100% earning power—regardless of their delegate’s real governance score. While the Tally ARB Staker is designed to distribute rewards only to stakers whose delegatees meet a certain eligibility threshold, pausing the oracle or allowing it to become stale bypasses this mechanism entirely.

By keeping the system perpetually paused (or failing to unpause), malicious or negligent parties undermine the primary incentive structure of the protocol. This effectively cancels out any differential rewards intended to encourage active governance participation. Although this scenario requires specific role access (i.e., the `oraclePauseGuardian` must be compromised, malicious, or coerced), the resulting system failure is severe enough to warrant a **medium** classification: the exploit is straightforward to carry out but somewhat limited by role-based privileges.

## Vulnerability Detail
The core contracts (notably `BinaryEligibilityOracleEarningPowerCalculator`) rely on the following logic to calculate staker eligibility:

```solidity
function getEarningPower(
    uint256 _amountStaked,
    address,
    address _delegatee
) external view returns (uint256) {
    if (_isOracleStale() || isOraclePaused) return _amountStaked;
    return _isDelegateeEligible(_delegatee) ? _amountStaked : 0;
}
```

Here, `_isOracleStale()` is:

```solidity
function _isOracleStale() internal view returns (bool) {
    return block.timestamp - lastOracleUpdateTime > STALE_ORACLE_WINDOW;
}
```

And pausing is done by the `oraclePauseGuardian` via:

```solidity
function setOracleState(bool _pauseOracle) public {
    if (msg.sender != oraclePauseGuardian) {
        revert BinaryEligibilityOracleEarningPowerCalculator__Unauthorized(
            "not oracle pause guardian", msg.sender
        );
    }
    emit OraclePausedStatusUpdated(isOraclePaused, _pauseOracle);
    isOraclePaused = _pauseOracle;
}
```

**Problematic Code Path**  
1. **Pausing**: `isOraclePaused = true;`  
2. **No Score Updates**: With the oracle paused (or stale past `STALE_ORACLE_WINDOW`), `_isOracleStale()` returns `true`.  
3. **Everyone Eligible**: `getEarningPower()` subsequently returns `_amountStaked` in all scenarios.  

**Test Code Snippet** (from the exploit demonstration)

```solidity
// 2. Malicious "pauseGuardian" forcibly pauses the oracle.
vm.prank(pauseGuardian);
calc.setOracleState(true);

// 3. Move forward in time > STALE_ORACLE_WINDOW => oracle becomes "stale".
vm.warp(block.timestamp + STALE_ORACLE_WINDOW + 1);

// 4. Everyone gets full earning power, ignoring real scores.
uint256 badEarningAfterPause = stakingCaller.getEarningPower(
    100 ether, stakerWithBadDelegate, address(0xBadDelegatee)
);
// badEarningAfterPause == 100 ether
```

Invariants dictate that **“only stakers whose delegatees meet a certain eligibility score can earn rewards.”** By making the system stale or paused indefinitely, this invariant is violated: *all* stakers are treated as meeting the threshold. This effectively defeats the protocol’s core governance-based reward distribution design.

## Recommendation


1. **Restrict or Decentralize Pause Authority**  
   - Require a multisig, DAO vote, or time-delayed mechanism for pausing. This ensures no single address can permanently subvert the protocol.
