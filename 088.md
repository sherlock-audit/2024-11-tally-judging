# Lack of Approval for Token Transfer between Surrogates

## Summary
When ```alterDelegatee``` is called it changes the delegates but also calls ```_fetchOrDeploySurrogate``` which deploys a new contract surrogate. Then we proceed with a safeTransfer from the old one to the new one. This will always fail since the old one didnt approved the new one. Broken Logic


## Impact
Broken Logic. ```alterDelegate``` will always fail and revert since token transfer from old one to the new one wont be able to transfer
