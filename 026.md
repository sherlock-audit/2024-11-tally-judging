# Earning Power is not updated when rewards to claim is zero

## Summary
Earning Power is not updated when rewards to claim is zero

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-tally/blob/main/staker/src/GovernanceStaker.sol#L710-L721

## Vulnerability Detail
Protocol attempts to update earning power on every user state changing calls, but fails to update the earning Power when Reward. is zero, this permits the user to keep accumulating rewards with previous earning power. Also, while there is an option for it to be updated by an third party, available reward is the incentive and user does not have.

## Impact
Rewards accumulation with old earning power

## Code Snippet
```solidity
 function _claimReward(DepositIdentifier _depositId, Deposit storage deposit, address _claimer)
    internal
    virtual
    returns (uint256)
  {
    _checkpointGlobalReward();
    _checkpointReward(deposit);

    uint256 _reward = deposit.scaledUnclaimedRewardCheckpoint / SCALE_FACTOR;
    // Intentionally reverts due to overflow if unclaimed rewards are less than fee.
    uint256 _payout = _reward - claimFeeParameters.feeAmount;
    if (_payout == 0) return 0;
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Update earning pwer even where zero reward is available.
