# "Critical Reward Precision Loss: Vulnerability in Calculating Tiny Rewards for Large Stakes



## Summary

This report outlines a critical **Reward Precision Loss** vulnerability in the smart contract’s reward distribution mechanism. When extremely small rewards are computed for very large staked amounts, integer arithmetic in Solidity causes a non-trivial loss of precision. The root issue is that multiplying a tiny reward by a large stake, then dividing by the total stake, can truncate fractional components. Although the deviation may appear insignificant in a single payout, these inaccuracies can accumulate over time, potentially leading to substantial discrepancies in rewards and undermining user confidence.

## Vulnerability Detail

1. **Mechanics of the Vulnerability**  
   - **Integer Arithmetic Truncation:** In Solidity, operations on `uint256` discard any fractional components. Therefore, if a small reward (e.g., `1 GWEI`) is multiplied by a large stake (e.g., `10,000,000 ETH`) and then divided by the total stake, the result can be significantly lower than the intended reward.  
   - **No Native Floating-Point:** Solidity lacks floating-point math, so fractional parts are lost during multiplication/division unless the developer implements a fixed-point or scaling approach.

2. **Where It Occurs in the Contract**

   a. [_scaledUnclaimedReward](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-tally/blob/b125d1f2b52170a3789b1060a52fc6609e6e2262/staker/src/GovernanceStaker.sol#L522-L525)()
   ```solidity
   function _scaledUnclaimedReward(Deposit storage deposit) internal view virtual returns (uint256) {
       return deposit.scaledUnclaimedRewardCheckpoint
         + (deposit.earningPower * (rewardPerTokenAccumulated() - deposit.rewardPerTokenCheckpoint));
   }
   ```
   - Here, `deposit.earningPower` (a `uint96`) is multiplied by the difference between two large integers (`rewardPerTokenAccumulated()` and `deposit.rewardPerTokenCheckpoint`). Because this is integer arithmetic, any fractional remainder is discarded.  
   - If `earningPower` is very large or if the difference in reward accumulators is relatively small (e.g., due to a tiny reward), the truncated fractions can accumulate to a noticeable shortfall over multiple distributions.

   b. **`rewardPerTokenAccumulated()`**  
   ```solidity
   function rewardPerTokenAccumulated() public view virtual returns (uint256) {
       if (totalEarningPower == 0) return rewardPerTokenAccumulatedCheckpoint;

       return rewardPerTokenAccumulatedCheckpoint
         + (scaledRewardRate * (lastTimeRewardDistributed() - lastCheckpointTime))
           / totalEarningPower;
   }
   ```
   - This function calculates the global reward per token.  
   - The expression `(scaledRewardRate * (lastTimeRewardDistributed() - lastCheckpointTime)) / totalEarningPower` uses integer division. If `scaledRewardRate` is small (due to a tiny reward) and `totalEarningPower` is extremely large, the division may truncate much of the fractional component, leading to understated rewards.

   c. **`notifyRewardAmount()`**  
   ```solidity
   if (block.timestamp >= rewardEndTime) {
       scaledRewardRate = (_amount * SCALE_FACTOR) / REWARD_DURATION;
   } else {
       uint256 _remainingReward = scaledRewardRate * (rewardEndTime - block.timestamp);
       scaledRewardRate = (_remainingReward + _amount * SCALE_FACTOR) / REWARD_DURATION;
   }
   ```
   - Although a `SCALE_FACTOR` (1e36) is applied to improve precision, a very small `_amount` can make `scaledRewardRate` still too low compared to a huge `totalEarningPower`. Later divisions by `totalEarningPower` can further reduce the reward portion.  
   - The contract attempts to maintain precision by scaling, but integer arithmetic can still lose fractions once you divide by large numbers.

3. **Example of Failure**  
   - **Expected Reward:** `1 GWEI`  
   - **Actual Reward:** `0.9999999 GWEI` (or even less, depending on scaling and integer truncation)  

   Repeated daily or across many participants, these rounding gaps can add up to a substantial overall discrepancy.

## Impact

1. **Incremental Financial Losses**  
   - **Underpayment of Stakers:** With each reward cycle, users may receive slightly less than expected. Over a long period or with frequent rewards, these underpayments accumulate into significant losses.  
   - **Potential Exploit:** A sophisticated actor could theoretically create transactions timed to maximize truncation, gradually siphoning reward shortfalls. Although it’s not a straightforward exploit, the risk remains non-negligible in edge cases.

2. **Reputational Risks**  
   - **Trust Erosion:** Users noticing persistent shortfalls in rewards will lose confidence in the protocol’s fairness and accuracy. Repeated precision errors can also raise questions about the contract’s overall integrity.

3. **System Instability**  
   - **Verification Failures:** Testing frameworks (e.g., Forge) rely on `assertApproxEqAbs` or similar checks. As soon as the result falls below the acceptance threshold, tests break. This signals the system may not meet its design specifications for precise reward distribution.  
   - **Inter-Contract Dependencies:** Other contracts or libraries expecting exact reward amounts might behave unpredictably if those expectations are not fulfilled, causing broader ecosystem issues.

## Code Snippet

Below is a distilled version of a test scenario demonstrating the discrepancy. Here, the assertion fails because the calculated reward is smaller than `tinyReward`:

```solidity
uint256 tinyReward = 1e9; // 1 GWEI
uint256 largeStake = 10_000_000e18; // 10M ETH
uint256 totalStake = largeStake;

uint256 reward = (tinyReward * largeStake) / totalStake;

// Test assertion fails due to precision loss
assertApproxEqAbs(reward, tinyReward, 1, "Precision issue for small reward");
```

A comparable logic path is seen in the actual contract code (`_scaledUnclaimedReward()` and `rewardPerTokenAccumulated()`), where integer operations similarly truncate fractions.

## Tool Used

**Manual Review**  
- The testing was performed by minting tokens, simulating reward calculations with large stakes, and then comparing expected vs. actual results.  
- A thorough review of the math in `_scaledUnclaimedReward()`, `rewardPerTokenAccumulated()`, and `notifyRewardAmount()` confirmed that integer division discards fractional components, producing under-rewards in edge scenarios.

## Recommendation

1. **Utilize Fixed-Point or High-Precision Libraries**  
   - **Libraries:** Integrate libraries such as [[ABDKMathQuad](https://github.com/abdk-consulting/abdk-libraries-solidity)](https://github.com/abdk-consulting/abdk-libraries-solidity) or [[PRBMath](https://github.com/PaulRBerg/prb-math)](https://github.com/PaulRBerg/prb-math), which preserve fractional components in critical multiplications/divisions.  
   - **Methodology:** Replace standard `uint256` math with fixed-point math to avoid integer truncation.

2. **Adopt a Scaling Strategy**  
   - **Scale Up, Then Scale Down:** Multiply all relevant values (e.g., `tinyReward`, `stakerStake`, etc.) by a large constant (e.g., `1e18`) before dividing, then scale down at the end.  
   - **Example Implementation:**
     ```solidity
     function calculateReward(uint256 tinyReward, uint256 stakerStake, uint256 totalStake)
         public
         pure
         returns (uint256)
     {
         require(totalStake > 0, "Total stake cannot be zero");
         uint256 scaledReward = (tinyReward * 1e18 * stakerStake) / totalStake; // Scale up
         return scaledReward / 1e18; // Scale down
     }
     ```
   - This ensures you capture and preserve the fractional value until the final step.

3. **Minimum Reward Threshold**  
   - **Threshold Setting:** If the calculated reward is below a certain cutoff (e.g., `1e5` Wei), accumulate it until it reaches a more meaningful amount. This avoids repeated micro-truncation for very tiny distributions.  
   - **Benefits:** Dramatically reduces the frequency of round-off events for negligible rewards.

4. **Comprehensive Testing and Fuzzing**  
   - **Edge Cases:**  
     - Extremely small reward amounts (1 GWEI or less).  
     - Extremely large stake totals (10M ETH or more).  
     - Large participant pools that amplify tiny rounding errors.  
   - **Fuzz Testing:** Randomly vary stakes and reward sizes to detect unanticipated rounding errors under diverse conditions.

5. **Clear Documentation**  
   - **Transparency:** Document known limitations around integer-based calculations and highlight potential rounding errors.  
   - **Versioning & Audits:** Track code changes impacting reward calculation logic. Periodic external audits help verify that any modifications do not reintroduce precision loss issues.
