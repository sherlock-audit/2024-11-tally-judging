# using alterClaimer() will Dos claimReward()

## Summary
A check in `GovernanceStaker.claimReward()` will always cause DOS if `alterClaimer()` is ever used.
```solidity
 if (deposit.claimer != msg.sender && deposit.owner != msg.sender) {
      revert GovernanceStaker__Unauthorized("not claimer or owner", msg.sender);
    }
```    
## Vulnerability Detail

The purpose of `alterClaimer()` is to grant a user the ability to change his `deposit.claimer`
```solidity
 /// @notice For an existing deposit, change the claimer account which has the right to
  /// withdraw staking rewards.
  /// @param _depositId Unique identifier of the deposit which will have its claimer altered.
  /// @param _newClaimer Address of the new claimer.
  /// @dev The new claimer may not be the zero address. The message sender must be the owner of
  /// the deposit.
  function alterClaimer(DepositIdentifier _depositId, address _newClaimer) external virtual {//@audit-issue using alterClaimer() will Dos claimReward()
    Deposit storage deposit = deposits[_depositId];
    _revertIfNotDepositOwner(deposit, msg.sender);
    _alterClaimer(deposit, _depositId, _newClaimer);
  }
```


When a user uses this function, he will not be able to successfully call `GovernanceStaker.claimReward()`
```solidity
 /// @notice Claim reward tokens earned by a given deposit. Message sender must be the claimer
  /// address of the deposit. Tokens are sent to the claimer address.
  /// @param _depositId Identifier of the deposit from which accrued rewards will be claimed.
  /// @return Amount of reward tokens claimed, after the fee has been assessed.
  function claimReward(DepositIdentifier _depositId) external virtual returns (uint256) {
    Deposit storage deposit = deposits[_depositId];
    if (deposit.claimer != msg.sender && deposit.owner != msg.sender) {//@audit
      revert GovernanceStaker__Unauthorized("not claimer or owner", msg.sender);
    }
    return _claimReward(_depositId, deposit, msg.sender);
  }
```
check the if statement which the @audit tag is on.. It will cause reverts when claimer is changed from original claimer which will be owner to a new address.
## Impact
reverts in `GovernanceStaker.claimReward()`

Breaks core functionality of alterClaimer() because it can't be used. and if it is used `GovernanceStaker.claimReward()` will revert

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The `alterClaimer()` function should be removed or the check in `GovernanceStaker.claimReward()` should be changed to 
```solidity
if ( deposit.owner != msg.sender) {//@audit
      revert GovernanceStaker__Unauthorized("not claimer or owner", msg.sender);
    }
```
