# Reward could be lost if there is no staker

## Summary
If there is a distribution and all the stakers withdraw, then for the rest of the reward duration, if no one stakes, the reward will be stuck forever.

## Vulnerability Detail
We can see here that the reward is distributed only if the totalEarningPower is higher than 0.
```solidity
function rewardPerTokenAccumulated() public view virtual returns (uint256) { 
   if (totalEarningPower == 0) return rewardPerTokenAccumulatedCheckpoint; 
  
   return rewardPerTokenAccumulatedCheckpoint 
     + (scaledRewardRate * (lastTimeRewardDistributed() - lastCheckpointTime)) / totalEarningPower; 
 } 
```
The problem is that if during a reward distribution all the stakers withdraw, then the funds will be stuck forever in the smart contract.
### Proof-Of-Concept
You can copy-paste this test in a contract of the GovernanceStaker.t.sol file and run `forge test --mt test_stuckBalancePOC`.
```solidity 
function test_stuckBalancePOC() public {
     address BOB = makeAddr("BOB");    
     // Bob stake 1 token 
    (, GovernanceStaker.DepositIdentifier _depositId) = _boundMintAndStake(BOB, 1e18,BOB);
     uint256 _rewardAmount = 1000e18;
     //The protocol notify some rewards
    _mintTransferAndNotifyReward( _rewardAmount);
    //We jump the half of the reward duration
    _jumpAheadByPercentOfRewardDuration(50);
    //Bob claim his rewards
     vm.prank(BOB);
    govStaker.claimReward(_depositId);
    //Bob the withdraw his staking balance
     vm.prank(BOB);
    govStaker.withdraw(_depositId,1e18);
    //We jump the rest of the reward duration
    _jumpAheadByPercentOfRewardDuration(50);
   uint256 unclaimedReward=  govStaker.unclaimedReward(_depositId);
   uint256 rewardGovBalance = rewardToken.balanceOf(address(govStaker));
   // we can see that Bob have no unclaimed reward
    assertEq(unclaimedReward, 0);
    //There is some funds that are stuck in the contract
    assertEq(rewardGovBalance, 500e18 +1);
   }
```

## Impact
The rewards will be stuck forever.

## Recommendation
The protocol should implement a function to redistribute the undistributed rewards.
