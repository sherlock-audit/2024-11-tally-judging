# scaledUnclaimedRewardCheckpoint is not properly reset to zero after the reward has been claimed in the GovernorStaker._claimReward()

## Summary
`scaledUnclaimedRewardCheckpoint` is not properly reset to zero after the reward has been claimed

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `GovernorStaker` contract, a comment is written by the protocol indicating that the value of  `scaledUnclaimedRewardCheckpoint` is set to 0 when deposit rewards are claimed. 
```solidity
  /// @param scaledUnclaimedRewardCheckpoint Checkpoint of the unclaimed rewards earned by a given
  /// deposit with the scale factor included. This value is stored any time an action is taken that
  /// specifically impacts the rate at which rewards are earned by a given deposit. Total unclaimed
  /// rewards for a deposit are thus this value plus all rewards earned after this checkpoint was
  /// taken. This value is reset to zero when the deposit's rewards are claimed.
```
However in the [_claimReward](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-tally/blob/main/staker/src/GovernanceStaker.sol#L710-L751) when deposits are claimed, the code currently only subtracts the reward from it. After this subtraction, theres not part in the snippet which set `scaledUnclaimedRewardCheckpoint` to 0, and this does not  align with what above the comment says.

```solidity
  function _claimReward(DepositIdentifier _depositId, Deposit storage deposit, address _claimer)
    internal
    virtual
    returns (uint256)
  {
    _checkpointGlobalReward();
    _checkpointReward(deposit);


    uint256 _reward = deposit.scaledUnclaimedRewardCheckpoint / SCALE_FACTOR;
    // Intentionally reverts due to overflow if unclaimed rewards are less than fee.
    uint256 _payout = _reward - claimFeeParameters.feeAmount;
    if (_payout == 0) return 0;


    // retain sub-wei dust that would be left due to the precision loss
    deposit.scaledUnclaimedRewardCheckpoint =
      deposit.scaledUnclaimedRewardCheckpoint - (_reward * SCALE_FACTOR);
    emit RewardClaimed(_depositId, _claimer, _payout);


    uint256 _newEarningPower =
      earningPowerCalculator.getEarningPower(deposit.balance, deposit.owner, deposit.delegatee);


    totalEarningPower =
      _calculateTotalEarningPower(deposit.earningPower, _newEarningPower, totalEarningPower);
    depositorTotalEarningPower[deposit.owner] = _calculateTotalEarningPower(
      deposit.earningPower, _newEarningPower, depositorTotalEarningPower[deposit.owner]
    );
    deposit.earningPower = _newEarningPower.toUint96();


    SafeERC20.safeTransfer(REWARD_TOKEN, _claimer, _payout);
    if (claimFeeParameters.feeAmount > 0) {
      SafeERC20.safeTransfer(
        REWARD_TOKEN, claimFeeParameters.feeCollector, claimFeeParameters.feeAmount
      );
    }
    return _payout;              // @audit>> scaledUnclaimedRewardCheckpoint is not set to 0 as comment says in ln:131-134
  }
```

## Impact
This may lead to incorrect reward calculations since the protocol has reasons for commenting that they would always reset the scaled Unclaimed Reward Checkpoint to 0 after deposit rewards are claimed.
